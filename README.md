# FLIKK
open source platformer game developed by a dumbass

## /// DEVELOPER'S STATEMENT ///

It's taken me a while to figure out what to do with this game.

But, without yapping, I will be releasing the source code of FLIKK to the public domain under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license. 

“This game and all associated assets are released into the public domain under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license. You can copy, modify, distribute, and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.”

And that's it. What I’ve always wanted to do is to give this game to someone who may love it as much as I do, but it seems that nobody in random Discord servers want to take it. Or nobody could use it at all, which is fine either way. 

What this means is that:
The GitHub repository will be made public, for all to request changes and develop further on the game.
You can use any of the resources contained in the game files anywhere, for free, without credit.
If you really wanted to, you could literally sell the game.

All I'm saying is. This is not my project anymore. This is yours. And this could all be for nothing. Literally nobody could do anything with it, and I'd still be happy in the hope that one day, someone with maybe a little more programming experience and a higher budget than me could take this project on and make it all that I imagined.

Plus, the backend, developed and managed by undefined06855 (whom I thank infinitely for) will also go under public domain with the same license.

On the less fortunate side of things:

The FLIKK online servers will be shut down on the 1st of May 2025.

Online levels will be backed up and shared under the same license as the actual game, but accounts will be fully wiped and deleted to respect privacy.

The game will undergo a takedown request from Steam on the same day.

I would also like to formally announce my retirement from game development. Without going into detail or making this too boring, I want to say a huge thanks to every one of you, for making this possible. This just isn't my thing anymore, and it's for the better.

I appreciate everything you guys have given me.
